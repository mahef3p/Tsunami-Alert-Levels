# Tsunami Alert Levels

**Gulf of Cádiz**: scripts to create the train, validation and test sets from the raw data (`create_npz.py`), to train the network (`train.py`), and to show graphically the results obtained by a given model (`show_graphic.py`) in the Gulf of Cádiz problem.

The `other_algorithms` directory contains scripts to apply random forests (`random_forest.py`), histogram-based gradient boosting trees (`hgbt.py`) and support vector machines (`svm.py`).

---

**Philippines_real_events**: scripts to create the train, validation and test sets from the raw data (`create_npz.py`), to train the network (`train.py`), and to predict the results obtained by a given model (`predict.py`) in the problem of Philippines with real events.

---

**Philippines_real_events_probabilistic**: script to predict the probabilistic results obtained by a given model (`predict.py`) in the problem of Philippines with real events.

---

**Philippines_three_segments**: scripts to create the train, validation and test sets from the raw data (`create_npz.py`), to train the network (`train.py`), and to show graphically the results obtained by a given model (`show_graphic.py`) in the problem of Philippines with three fault segments.

The `other_algorithms` directory contains scripts to apply random forests (`random_forest.py`), histogram-based gradient boosting trees (`hgbt.py`) and support vector machines (`svm.py`).
